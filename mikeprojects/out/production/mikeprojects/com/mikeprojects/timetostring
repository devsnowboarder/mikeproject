/*We would like to convert a time (like 5:10) to the time in words (like "ten past five").

        To solve this, you will need a method that takes two integer inputs (hour and minute), and returns a string. Some example inputs and outputs of this method are the following:

        timeInWords(12, 0)  -->  "twelve o'clock"
        timeInWords(1,  5)  -->  "five past one"
        timeInWords(2, 15)  -->  "quarter past two"
        timeInWords(3, 30)  -->  "half past three"
        timeInWords(4, 40)  -->  "twenty to five"

        You may assume the following:

        1. 12-hour time format
        2. Your inputs will NOT necessarily be valid (you must handle invalid cases somehow)
        3. You have some method (or a map) that takes an integer and returns the string representation:
        numberToString(1)   -->  "one"
        numberToString(15)  -->  "quarter"

        Example method signatures for Java and JavaScript are below. Please provide the implementation. You may use any programming language that you'd like (not just Java or JavaScript).

//public String timeInWords(int hour, int minute) {

  //  public static void main(String args[])throws IOException
    //{
      //  BufferedReader br=new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));

        /* Inputting hours and minutes */
//      System.out.print("Enter Hours : ");
//          int h=Integer.parseInt(br.readLine());

/*
                 System.out.print("Enter Minutes : ");
                         int m=Integer.parseInt(br.readLine());

                         if((h>=1 && h<=12) && (m>=0 && m<=59)) // checking whether given input is legal or not.
                         {
                         /* creating an array containing numbers from 1-29 in words */

                          * because if we print an hour ahead of 12, it will be thirteen, but we want 1
                          * so the below code checks this & decides what hour to print in words when minutes is from 31-59
